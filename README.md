# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Evan and I'm in the web app security space. I graduated from Dakota State University and my main interests revolve around application security; learning more about web application penetration testing, secure code review, bug bounty hunting, etc.

Currently I'm diving deeper into trying to get my hands dirty by creating my own tooling and getting more familiar with Go, but I'm also excited about leveraging Burp Suite BChecks and extensions to make pentesting processes more efficient and comprehensive.  

Here you'll find my random repositories of projects, papers from college, and some other random items. You can reach me on Signal: alp1n3.01. Also feel free to check out my blog @ [alp1n3.dev](https://alp1n3.dev).
